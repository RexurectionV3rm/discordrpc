#DISCOUNTINUED

# Requirements and explanations

A CLI (Command Line Interface) that makes you generate a Discord Rich Presence without you coding anything!
* **NOTE** These are the libraries you will need to install before running the program, to install open CMD and type following commands one by one (requires latest node.js)
```
npm install readline,fs,discord-rpc,process,prompt-sync,dotenv
```

# TODO List!

- [x] Publish on github!
- [x] Add a license.
- [ ] Create an automatic executable file. (VERY SOON)
- [ ] Create a mobile version. (Will try to)
